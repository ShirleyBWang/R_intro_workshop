# Introduction to R
Instructor: Shirley Wang, A.M. 

R is increasingly used for data cleaning, wrangling, visualization, and analysis across the social, behavioral, and brain sciences. This workshop aims to provide an introduction to R for researchers with prior data analysis experience in other statistical software programs (e.g., SPSS, JMP), but no prior experience in R. Day 1 will focus on R basics, data cleaning, and data wrangling. Day 2 will focus on data visualization (base R and ggplot) and data analysis (correlation, regression, t-tests, ANOVA). Please download the slides and R scripts here before each day, and reach out with any questions!
